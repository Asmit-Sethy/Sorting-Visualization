# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based tool that provides an interactive way to understand how different sorting algorithms work. It visually represents sorting methods through graphs and allows users to control the size of the array and the speed of the visualization.

## Sorting Methods Used

- **Bubble Sort**: A comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one item at a time by inserting each new element into its correct position.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into sub-arrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together.
- **Quick Sort**: Divides the array into partitions, sorts each partition, and then combines them.
- **Selection Sort**: Selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
